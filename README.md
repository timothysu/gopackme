# Sparkmail - Ephemeral Email
*THIS MESSAGE WILL SELF-DESTRUCT*

**Sparkmail is a new take on the world's most popular communication medium.**

## How-To:
![Sparkmail Example](http://sparkmail.me/img/example_sm.png)

1. Send to "send@sparkmail.me"
2. Insert your recipient's email into the subject line
3. Write your message body and/or attach a photo (pre-alpha)
4. Send your Spark!



We sought to build an open ephemeral messaging system accessible to anyone with an email address.  To accomplish this, Sparkmail was built to require no installation, setup, or registration.

Our stack consists of Node.js on a Digital Ocean droplet with integration of [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com) for mass campaigns.  We're most proud of the innovative methods developed to enable Sparkmail's core functionality - detecting when someone has opened the email, and deleting it immediately after.
